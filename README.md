# Car-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis

This project aims to predict car prices using various machine learning regression models accurately. It involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to determine the most effective algorithms for the task.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Visualized distributions of car manufacturers, transmission types, fuel types, and vehicle sizes.
    
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
    Handled missing values and outliers through imputation and removal techniques.
    
Feature Engineering:
    Created a new feature, Years of Manufacture, to model vehicle depreciation over time.
    
Encoding & Scaling:
    Used target encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables; standardized numerical features for optimal model performance.
    
Model Training & Evaluation:
Implemented and compared several regression models:
  Linear Regression
  Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  K-Nearest Neighbours Regressor (KNN)
  Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression
  Decision Tree Regressor
  Gradient Boosting Regressor
  Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor
   
Evaluation Metrics:
  Models were assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
